**Describe how you confirmed the issue is with the library, and not with the API itself, or a server-side issue of some other kind.**
You can usually confirm it's an issue with the library itself (or with Python) if you've executed the same operations using other tools (e.g. Postman, or Python `requests` library) and if you only have the issue when using this library. For example, if you can't reproduce it with Postman, then it might be a library issue. *On the other hand*, if you can reproduce it across platforms, then it's probably *not* an issue with the library. In that case, please report the issue to Meraki support. 

**Python version installed**
Which specific Python version are you using?

**Meraki library version installed**
Which specific version of the library are you using?

**Have you reproduced the issue with the latest version of this library? Or with the latest version of Python?**

**OS Platform**
Which OS has the problem? E.g. Linux, Windows 10, macOS 14, etc.

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is, and why it seems to be a bug.

**How can we replicate the problem you're reporting?**
Please provide enough steps so that we can reproduce the issue. It helps if you can share a link to the endpoint's page on [the interactive docs site](https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/api-v1/#!api-reference-overview). **We and Meraki Support will never need or ask for your API key or dashboard login credentials, so please don't share them.**

For example, to reproduce:
1. Invoke X endpoint with Y request attributes and/or Z query parameters.
2. Expect outcome A.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen instead, and why.

**Code snippets**
If applicable, add code snippets to help explain your problem.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
